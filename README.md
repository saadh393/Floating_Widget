# Floating_Widget
 
Floating widgets are the views that float over the screen. This view will remain floating on the screen no matter whichever screen you are in. They are very convenient for multitasking as a user can work on other application and control your application for the same time. That means if you are in the calculator application and a widget from the music player is floating over the screen, you can control your music at the same time. Pretty cool!
